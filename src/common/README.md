# Common library

You can think of this as the standard library for our game engine. The library contains some core building blocks (memory, file system I/O) and basic data structures (dynamic list, hash map). It's a good place to put things you are going to use everywhere but it is not the right place to put things that are needed for specific/unrelated problems because it is convenient.
